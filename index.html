    <p>Hi I'm Vinz. I'm a computer science major at UCR. I was born in the Philippines, but at the young age of four, I
        immigrated to the United States, and I've lived in Southern California ever since. Growing up, I was all around
        computers and videogames. I would come home from school to play TF2 and Minecraft with my friends all day long.
        I even ended up making some Let's Plays on YouTube, thinking that was what I wanted to do when I grew up. The
        videos are extremely cringy, so please do not watch them.
        Going into college I had no prior experience with computer science, but I knew that I wanted to be in the
        tech industry. When the pandemic hit, I figured it was a good idea to start exposing myself to what I
        thought I wanted to do for the rest of my life, so I went through the entirety of the Harvard CS50x course on
        edX. The course was like drinking out of a firehydrant, but I quickly realized how much I enjoyed learning about
        all the different sides of CS. Going into my first year, even through it was completely online, I tried to get
        as involved as possible, attending two hackathons and getting involved in ACM. I'm still trying to figure out
        what I really want to do in computer science, but I have a feeling I'm getting closer and closer with every
        nugget of information I learn about what it has in store.</p>
